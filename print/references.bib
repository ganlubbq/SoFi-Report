  abstract = {Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation concerns the estimation of direction finding signals in the form of electromagnetic or acoustic waves, impinging on a sensor or antenna array. DOA estimation is used for locating and tracking signal sources in both civilian and military applications. This authoritative volume provides an overview and performance analysis of the basic DOA algorithms, including comparisons between the various types. The book offers you a detailed understanding of the arrays pertinent to DOA finding, and presents a detailed illustration of the ESPRIT-based DOA algorithms compl.},
