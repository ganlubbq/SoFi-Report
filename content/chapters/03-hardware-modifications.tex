Figure \ref{img:block_sdr_dongle} shows a block
diagram of one of the receivers dongles that where used
in this project.
The two main components on the dongle are a \texttt{R820T2} tuner IC
and a \texttt{RTL2832U} DVB-T receiver IC. \\

The tuner IC contains circuitry to drive an
external crystal for clock generation.
The crystal used on the hardware at hand
operates at a frequency of \SI{28.8}{\mega\hertz}.
The tuner uses this frequency to derive the
local oscillator signal used for mixing down
the RF-signal using a phase locked loop.
It also provides a clock output pin that
outputs a triangle waveform at the crystal
frequency. \\

The given USB-dongles uses this clock output
as an input for the \texttt{RTL2832U}
receiver IC that handles the analog to digital
conversion and USB-communication.
The ADC sampling frequency is derived from
the tuner clock output by using a phase locked loop. \\

In the basic setup four SDR dongles are used
to operate the antenna array.
In order to be able to compare the signal phases
received by these dongles they have to be tightly
synchronized in time and frequency. \\

Gaining sufficient synchronization for DOA applications
by compensating for hardware differences completely
in software was deemed not feasible so a hybrid
approach was choosen that requires minimal hardware
modifications. \\

%       radar stuff

Figure \ref{img:block_sdr_dongle_chained} shows
a schematic representation of the performed modifications.
The clock output of one tuner ic is daisy chained to
the clock input of the next tuner ic.
This way all tuners derive their clock frequency
from the same crystal while the load on any of
the clock outputs is kept minimal.

To provide the input pin with the correct signal
levels a DC blocking RC network has to be used
on the input pins.

The modifications that were actually performed on the
hardware can be seen in figure \ref{img:hw_mods}.
The dongle that contains the clock reference for
the rest of the system can be seen in the top left
image, it still contains the original
\SI{28.8}{\mega\hertz} crystal and was only equipped
with thin wires that tap off the clock out signal
and a ground reference. \\

The next image to the right shows a dongle
that comes later in the clock chain.
The original crystal was removed an replaced with
the RC-network shown in figure \ref{img:block_sdr_dongle_chained}.
The network is fed by the previos dongle in the chain. \\

The bottom right image in the figure shows the
locations of the main components on the dongles.
