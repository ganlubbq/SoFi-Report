In addition to frequency locking that is performed in
hardware additional synchronization steps have to
be performed. These steps are now presented in the
order they are performed. \\

The first offset that needs to be compensated stems
from the fact, that the SDR-dongles do not start
recording samples at the same time.
This effect is demonstrated in figures
\ref{img:samples_actual_time} to \ref{img:samples_synchronized_time}. \\

             {0.5}

             {img:samples_observed_time}
             {Sample times when read from the device}
             {0.5}

\figurizefile{diagrams/samples_synchronized_time.tex}
             {img:samples_synchronized_time}
             {Samples after sample-exact synchronization}
             {0.5}
